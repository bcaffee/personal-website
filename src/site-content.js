The art difference from the previous, now archaic, version of House Match already demonstrates justice in cleaning the game up. However, besides fixing the almost seemingly infinite number of bugs, there were plenty of gameplay features and nice-to-haves that I worked on, like the tutorial and pause menus, the scoring system, and the leaderboard.</p><p>Spending hours on this project every day and meeting up online with the three other team members was an awesome experience. I’m so glad it all built up to us publicly releasing in October.

It was the most significant game project I've been part of and a tremendous learning experience. However, it wouldn't have been possible without Nathan's expertise and mentoring me, so please check out his website.</p><p>Prototype57 is incomplete, and we are no longer developing it, but you can try out the latest Unity and Unreal builds at <a href=' https://njlaha.notion.site/'>https://njlaha.notion.site</a>. Game development has always appealed to me, so it is something I plan to continue as a hobby in the future.

We were in class about 5 hours a week, working a little bit at home, and then for the last month, it became crunch time, so I spent a lot of time after school trying to get everything ready for the end of the year demo and mock 'tech panel.'</p> <p> I mainly worked on general VR functions such as the player interacting with objects and the main menu, the puzzle completion system, and the scale puzzle. Despite being frustrating at points, I overall enjoyed creating this game since I could dedicate a whole class to throw myself into VR development for the first time from scratch.</p>",

These features, among others, have made me enjoy games like <a href='https://github.com/crawl/crawl'> Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a>, so in 2016 I made my own in Java. This was the first sophisticated game I made when I started programming and the first big Java project that I've continually developed.</p><p>There are two main things I’m working on at the moment. One, making the random map that gets generated more difficult as the player progresses through the game. And two, slightly improving the general complexity of the game, so it’s not too easy or boring for the player to stumble into the next challenge. More specifically, this can entail introducing enemies that can move and adding a “magic compass” to help the player find puzzles.</p>",

        "<p>For this project, I used Java to create the customization GUI and draw the fractal. Inspiration came from wanting to better my Java graphic skills and using recursion to make art. The GUI itself has a lot of room for improvement since I rushed through that part. However, I’m thrilled with how the fractals turned out. For simplicity, the “tethered radial” part of the drawings means “connected circles.” </p> <p>The customization options include color, child fractal count, child depth, child-parent ratio, and dark or light mode. Besides some small bugs with the drawing panel creation and the dark mode not always working, the next steps are to add real-time drawing as the settings are changed and to include a warning plus stop drawing once the child fractals get too small. While working on this application, I learned about a cool abstract math <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4'>video</a> about why fractals are typically not self-similar, and I highly recommend it.</p>",

      modalInfo:
        "<p> When I started this project in 2019, I wanted to teach the computer/agent to play the traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe and then see how and if its game strategy would change when the board gets expanded to higher dimensions like 5x5 or 7x7. I used Deep quality learning to do this, which combines Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm that creates state-based growth through experiencing rewards and punishments, and neural networks. One interesting thing is that since I decided to have the agent always move first in training early on, it developed one strategy, but then if it played in an actual game with a human player moving second, it would make fatal mistakes and lose every time. This issue caused me to play around with other variables, such as the difference between having the agent train against itself versus having it train against random moves.</p> <p>Now I've gotten it to the point where the computer always ties against a human player since I stuck with the former, and its training consists of an equal number of games moving first and second. Winning only really happens if people make mistakes which is rare. I'm currently working on expanding the board and finding a way for the agent to get smarter without needing to experience every single board state.</p>",

I didn't realize how long I would spend designing or pruning annoying placement bugs.

In 2013, I also completed Khan Academy's new at the time JavaScript course. But I felt behind \"modern\" methods, so I looked into Vue.js and other frameworks. Eventually, I settled on React for its flexibility and <a href=https://mui.com/>Material UI</a>. Even though completing the site took longer than I had initially intended, I picked up many skills and don't regret it!</p>",

I remember being slightly worried that I wouldn't even be able to contribute much. Thankfully, I ended up learning a lot and spent most of my time integrating Twitch's API and making part of the main menu UI.</p><p>My most memorable moments were everyone frantically trying to get everything working last second before the judges came over and me being super unprepared for the night, sleeping on a table using my backpack as a pillow. Overall, this experience was well worth it as it inspired me to continue sharping my Unity skills and trying out VR development.
